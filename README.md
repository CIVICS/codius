+ [__node-sandbox__](https://github.com/codius/node-sandbox) - the pure javascript sandbox we're using while we work on getting Google's Native Client integrated
+ [__example-helloworld__](https://github.com/codius/example-helloworld) - a simple hello world contract
+ [__example-require__](https://github.com/codius/example-require) - a sample contract demonstrating how require works inside the sandbox
+ [__example-bitcoin__](https://github.com/codius/example-bitcoin) - a sample bitcoin contract that demonstrates how bitcoinjs can be used inside the sandbox
+ [__example-webserver__](https://github.com/codius/example-webserver/) - a sample contract demonstrating running a simple webserver inside a contract


We pulled multiple late nights to try to wrangle together an impressive demo for you all but we'll need a couple more days to make that happen. That said, we wanted to get all of this open sourced as soon as we could to get you involved in building this!

If you're interested, play around with the code, ask us questions on the forum or live chat, and feel free to submit pull requests!
